# Third-Party Licenses

This workspace depends on and/or adapts behavior from several upstream open-source projects.

This file is not a full machine-generated dependency inventory. It is a focused attribution file for the primary upstream projects that are materially relevant to this repository's source code, inference behavior, or distributed functionality.

## Primary Upstream Projects

| Project | Role in this repository | Upstream | License |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|---------|
| OmniVoice | Behavioral source of truth for inference, prompt preparation, chunking, and postprocess logic | https://github.com/k2-fsa/OmniVoice | Apache-2.0 |
| candle | Rust ML runtime used by this workspace; local workspace also references Whisper mel-filter assets from Candle examples | https://github.com/huggingface/candle | Apache-2.0 or MIT |
| mistral.rs | Crates.io dependencies from the mistral.rs ecosystem are used for audio/quantization support (`mistralrs-quant`, optional `mistralrs-audio`) | https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs | MIT |

## Notes

- Local upstream checkouts are used as engineering reference material and are not part of version control.
- This repository does not vendor the full source trees of `OmniVoice`, `candle`, or `mistral.rs`.
- When code or behavior is adapted from upstream, the corresponding upstream license remains applicable to those adapted portions.
- For a complete dependency-level inventory of the final binary distribution, generate a crate-level report separately from the exact locked dependency graph used for release builds.

## OmniVoice

Upstream project: `k2-fsa/OmniVoice`

License: Apache License 2.0

Relevant use in this repository:

- inference behavior and parity target
- prompt preparation semantics
- chunked generation semantics

License reference:

- upstream project metadata declares `Apache-2.0`
- local development should retain a copy of the upstream license text when OmniVoice-derived code is adapted

## candle

Upstream project: `huggingface/candle`

License: dual-licensed under Apache-2.0 or MIT

Relevant use in this repository:
